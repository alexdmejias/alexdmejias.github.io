<p>This is an attempt to follow the exercises from Nature of Code in pure Javascript (with the Canvas API). The exercises have already been ported to P5.js by Dan himself, but I thought it would be great to see each exercise written in native Javascript. Using a different implementation that the author, I have been forced to actually thing about the exercise and the topic ahead more in-depth, as opposed to coping and pasting what the author has already done.</p>

<p>This has been a great project to work on, as each of the exercises touches on subjects that as a Full Stack Developer doesn't usually get to interact with.</p>

<p>This is an ongoing project.</p>

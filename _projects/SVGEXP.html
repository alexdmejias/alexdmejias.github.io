<p>An ongoing series of small experiments revolving around the capabilities of SVG on the web and how it could be harnessed for something other than just images. You can view a simple set of goals in the projects (link: https://github.com/alexdmejias/SVGEXP/blob/master/README.md text: Readme file).</p>

<p>Built with (link:http://svgjs.com/ text:svg.js) and Require.js. Due to the way that this experiment works, it was asking to get modularized. Out of the major SVG libraries out there, I chose svg.js due to the fact that I mainly needed an SVG wrapper and not all the other features that the other libraries like (link: http://jonobr1.github.io/two.js/ text:two.js) or (link:http://snapsvg.io/ text:snap.svg) offer. I chose Require.js because of my familiarityâ€Ž with it, but I might switch to Browserify due to its syntax and ease of use.</p>
